! Do order: BASE + typography > general layout + grid > page layout > components

! Pay attention
If you want to have full control over the size of the elements 
on your website, and make it look consistent across different devices, then you can use "px".

If you want to have a responsive website that adapts to different screen sizes
, then using "rem" is a better option. "rem" units are relative to the root element (usually the HTML tag) and their size can be easily adjusted with CSS media queries.

In general, it's recommended to use "rem" for font-sizes
and "px" for other elements such as padding and margins. This allows for a good balance between control and responsiveness.
